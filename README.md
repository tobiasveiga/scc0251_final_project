# scc0251 - Final Project : Segmentation of Handwritten Notes for Fast Flashcard Generation

Author: Tobias Mesquita Silva da Veiga, 5268356

This is my final project of the Image Processing lectures taught at the ICMC-USP in 2020.01.

## Abstract

The goal here is to create an algorithm capable of 1) receiving real photos of handwritten students notebooks in which blocks of content are highlighted and 2) Returning the segmented region with only the highlighted content (this will be a side of a flashcard), while also 3) using OCR to retrieve textual information that could be used for recommending tags for the flashcard.

Therefore this project targets the educational area, through the use of image segmentation techniques. 

Below are some examples of handwritten notes with highlighted content that the algorithm is supposed to segment.
